**HTML5 Layout**
 Authors used `class` or `id` attributes to indicate the role of the `<div>` element in the structure of the page.

In Html5 you have a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them.
such as `<header>`,`<footer>`,`<main>`,`<article>`

The `<header>`used to contain the site
name and the main navigation,also title and
date.

The `<footer>`used to contain
copyright information, along
with links to the privacy policy
and terms and conditions

The `<nav>` element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site 

The `<article>` element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated

The `<aside>` element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an `<article>`
element or not.

The `<section>` element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.

The purpose of the `<hgroup>`
element is to group together a
set of one or more `<h1>` through
`<h6>` elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.

You already met the `<figure>`
element in Chapter 5 when we
looked at images. It can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article (not just images). 

Examples of usage include:
- Images
- Videos
- Graphs
- Diagrams
- Code samples
- Text that supports the main body of an article

 the `<div>` it is  way to group together related elements

 you can use `<a>` element around
a block level element that
contains child elements. This
allows you to turn an entire block
into a link.



***Process & Design***

- It's imperative to comprehend who your intended interest group is, the reason they would go to your site, what data they need to discover and when they are probably going to return. 

- Site maps permit you to design the construction of a site. 

- Wireframes permit you to coordinate the data that should go on each page. 

- Design is about correspondence. Visual progression makes a difference guests comprehend what you are attempting to advise them. 

- You can separate between snippets of data  utilizing size, shading, and style. 

- You can utilize gathering and similitude to help rearrange the data you present.
