1. challenges, in the fixed mindset you will give up whenever you faced a problem, but in the growth mindset you will stop and think then moving step by step to solve your problems
2. Obstacles, or like the writer called it “instant gratification monkey syndrome.”, so in the fixed mindset if you faced an obstacle you will lose your focus and try to do anything to avoid the obstacles. However, in the growth mindset, you will persist and keep moving until you reach your goal.
3. Effort, if you faced difficult activities and your mind show you some of the views fruitless so that is a fixed mindset, and you need think like growth mindset 'no pain, no gain'
4. Criticism, you need to criticize yourself and learn from it to know where is your mistakes to avoid them next time. but in a fixed mindset, you will ignore everything.
5. Success of others, when your mind is a growth mindset you will see those whom you consider your competitors are complemented to you and have a passion for learning.

_finally, I need to remember myself to be a growth mindset by these statements, remember to face your problem, fight unproductive thoughts, and criticize myself to learn from my mistakes._
