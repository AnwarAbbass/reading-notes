  * Make a request to a third-party API endpoint 
  * Make a request to the access token endpoint 
  * Receive access token
  * Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint 
  * Receive authorization code 


* What can you do with an authorization code?

* **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

* **Authorization**

* **Information Exchange**



### What is the JSON Web Token structure?
* JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots `(.)`, which are:
  * Header
  * Payload
  * Signature
