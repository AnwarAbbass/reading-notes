*b 
just add space after * 
* a
* b

or by using - befor the items

- b

__ordered lists__:
ordered list is very easy just put the number then dot then space then the item, in ordered list if you put 1 before all elements ordered list will sorte your list like that 
1.a 2.b or 1.a 1.b the output will looks like that
